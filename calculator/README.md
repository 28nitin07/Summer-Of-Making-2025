# Calculator

This is my first project on SOM so I decided to make a simple terminal-based calculator based on python.






## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponential Multiplication

The calculations can also be done as many times as the user wants until they stop the program.
